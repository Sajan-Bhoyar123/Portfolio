My 8-Month Coding Bootcamp Journey: From Java Basics to Full Stack Projects
In December 2023, I made a pivotal decision to join an 8-month coding batch that would shape my skills and mindset for the tech industry. The batch was divided into two focused phases: the first four months were dedicated to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and the following four months focused on Full Stack Web Development. Here‚Äôs an honest walkthrough of my experience ‚Äî the ups, the setbacks, and the learnings that came from it.

üöÄ The Beginning: December 24th, 2023
The very first session was an introduction to the batch, including instructions to join the Telegram and Discord communities. In the first 7‚Äì15 days, we covered Java basics like flowcharts, pseudocode, variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and patterns ‚Äî both basic and advanced. We wrapped up this phase with functions and methods.

Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt face much difficulty here. I had already explored these topics on YouTube in my free time. After my 12th board exams, I had learned C language during the summer, so Java basics felt manageable.

Each lecture was uploaded on alternate days, with live sessions from professionals working in top MNCs. These sessions were for resolving practice questions provided after each topic.

At this point, I didn‚Äôt attend live sessions ‚Äî not because I wasn‚Äôt interested, but because I didn't have doubts yet. I had joined this batch during the 2nd semester of my 1st year, and I had a solid daily routine: I woke up at 3:45 AM and studied from 4:15 to 6:15 AM ‚Äî watching the recorded lectures and solving practice questions.

üìò Moving Ahead with DSA: The Middle Phase
After basics, we dove into core data structures ‚Äî arrays, sorting algorithms, 2D arrays, strings, bit manipulation, recursion, divide and conquer, backtracking, ArrayLists, and Linked Lists. Initially, I found these topics approachable.

But things changed with recursion and backtracking. I hit my first real challenge. I felt frustrated ‚Äî understanding subproblems, dry runs, and the logic behind recursive calls felt overwhelming. That was the first time I truly struggled.

Until then, I relied on ChatGPT and dry runs to understand my doubts ‚Äî which helped me stay on track. I wasn't interested in attending too many live sessions or consuming more content. Instead, I focused on clarity over quantity, analyzing small concepts deeply to avoid information overload.

During this time, we also had mentorship sessions on LinkedIn optimization and Google Summer of Code (GSoC), which included additional curated content.

üìä Theory + Advanced DSA
Following recursion and backtracking, we explored:

Time & Space Complexity

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Computer Networking

Operating Systems

Then came advanced DSA, including:

Stacks and Queues

Grid problems

BSTs and Binary Trees

Heaps and Hashing

Tries and Graphs

Dynamic Programming (DP)

Segment Trees

These were the toughest topics. I had a hard time keeping up, especially while balancing college. The batch moved forward, and I started falling behind.

I made one major mistake here ‚Äî I stopped practicing. I only watched the lectures and made notes. No coding practice, no implementation ‚Äî which is a recipe for "tutorial hell." This was the biggest regret of my DSA phase. I wasn‚Äôt building problem-solving confidence.

üèÅ DSA Done, But Not Confident
By the time I completed my second semester and the DSA phase ended, I had covered all topics but wasn‚Äôt confident solving problems independently. I hadn't practiced on coding platforms much, and I knew I needed to change that.

So, during my third semester and summer vacation, I focused on:

Solving all the pending batch questions

Practicing regularly on platforms

Making detailed dry run notes for future reference

This phase really helped strengthen my foundation.

üßë‚Äçüíª Full Stack Web Development Journey
After DSA, the batch shifted focus to full stack web development. Here's what I covered:

Frontend Phase:
HTML & CSS (built mini projects like landing pages)

Bootstrap (created a Spotify UI clone)

JavaScript ‚Äì The batch included 13 lectures covering JS from basics to advanced. This part felt a bit overwhelming, but I pushed through.

Git & GitHub ‚Äì Learned how to manage code with version control.

To practice front-end, I built:

Amazon front-end clone

Hotstar UI clone

Re-created the Spotify UI using only HTML & CSS

Backend Phase:
Node.js and Express.js

EJS templating

RESTful APIs

Databases:

SQL and MongoDB

Integrating SQL with Node

MongoDB with Express

Error Handling & Middlewares

With this knowledge, I built my first full-stack project ‚Äî an Airbnb Clone named Wanderlust.

Then I moved on to learning:

React:
In the React phase of my learning, I explored core concepts like components, state, props, and controlled elements in forms. To strengthen my understanding, I built several practical projects including an Expense Tracker, a VizApp, and a Recipe Finder that integrates external APIs. I also developed a ToDo app and a basic version of a social media platform like Instagram, where I implemented a dynamic comment form using React states and props. One of the most exciting mini-projects was a Lottery App, where users could generate tickets and win prize money based on winning combinations. After completing the batch, I continued building mini-projects for practice and experimentation, such as a Blogger App, a Social Media App, and a Weather App powered by API integration. These hands-on experiences helped me grasp React‚Äôs power in building interactive and scalable user interfaces.

Redux Toolkit

Tailwind CSS

üéØ Final Phase & Beyond
After completing the full 8-month batch, I transitioned into:

Regular coding practice

Participating in hackathons in various cities

Building more projects to sharpen my skills

Even now, my learning continues ‚Äî but this batch gave me a structured, powerful foundation to build on.

üí° Key Takeaways
Start early and be consistent ‚Äî I woke up at 3:45 AM every day!

Don‚Äôt skip practice questions ‚Äî tutorials alone won‚Äôt help.

Make detailed dry run notes ‚Äî your future self will thank you.

If a topic frustrates you (like recursion did for me), don‚Äôt give up.

Balancing college and coding is hard ‚Äî but not impossible.

Consuming too much content isn‚Äôt productive; focus on depth, not just breadth.

Stay honest about your progress ‚Äî and pivot when needed.
