Aarogyam: Building a HealthTech Platform at IIT Indore

After wrapping up my first project, I was hungry for something more challenging. That’s when the opportunity came to participate in a hackathon at IIT Indore—and honestly, it turned out to be one of the most memorable tech journeys I’ve had so far. Our project, Aarogyam, wasn’t just a submission—it was an experience that pushed me way out of my comfort zone and deep into the backend of modern web development.

From Idea to Implementation

This was only my second major project, and we entered the first round by submitting the core idea—a health management platform where users could track symptoms, access personalized health recommendations, and securely store their medical records. We used the MERN Stack, and I took the lead on integrating most of the backend functionalities.

I spent hours structuring our database, setting up proper models in MongoDB, designing secure routes with Node.js and Express, and linking the user data to the frontend. Until this point, database management had been a theory topic for me. But Aarogyam gave me my first real hands-on battle with schemas, routes, and data validation—and it was honestly thrilling to see everything come to life.

IIT Indore: A Campus That Breathes Innovation

In the second round, we headed to IIT Indore for an on-site presentation. The three-day event wasn’t just about coding—it was about immersing ourselves in a vibrant atmosphere full of aspiring innovators. Walking across that campus, I felt like I was stepping into the future. We met brilliant minds, interacted with developers who had already launched startups, and got valuable feedback on our tech stack and problem-solving approach.

Late Nights, Debug Fights, and Bright Lights

While I was managing the database and core logic, our team collaborated on polishing the UI and preparing our demo. Each night was a new adventure—fixing bugs, updating routes, and ensuring every button did what it was supposed to. But the real magic happened outside the codebase.

The cultural night on campus was something else. Imagine going from reviewing JSON responses to dancing at a live concert under the stars. That night reminded me that hackathons aren’t just tech marathons—they're bonding experiences.

What I Took Away

Full-Stack Confidence: I realized I could own an entire backend module—from schema design to deployment. That confidence was a huge leap forward for me.

Learning by Doing: No tutorial could’ve taught me what debugging a live database issue at 3 AM did.

Lead, Don’t Wait: Taking charge of the project helped me grow not just technically, but also as a team contributor and problem solver.

People Matter: The mentors, the participants, the campus vibe—all of it showed me the value of community in tech.

Final Thoughts

Aarogyam wasn’t just a project—it was a deep dive into real-world development. It taught me how to take an abstract healthtech idea and turn it into something functional and impactful. It challenged me, inspired me, and helped me grow in ways I didn’t expect.

Looking back, I didn’t just build a backend—I built belief in my own capabilities.
