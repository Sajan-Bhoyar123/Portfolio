🚀 My First Four Hackathons – A Rollercoaster Ride of Learning, Coding & Memories!

Hackathons have this magical way of pushing you to your limits, showing you what you're capable of, and giving you stories you’ll remember for life. For me, this journey began unexpectedly and quickly became one of the most thrilling chapters of my life.

🧩 Hackathon 1 – Code of Phoenix, IIIT Naya Raipur (15–16 Feb 2025)

It all started with a call from a friend whose team member dropped out. He asked if I was free for a hackathon. I said yes without overthinking — and that was the trigger point.

We met in his hostel room, brainstormed ideas, and began prepping. That same evening, we got an acceptance call from IIIT Naya Raipur for the onsite round. It was real. A 24-hour hackathon awaited us.

The Challenge:
Build a Web3-based cross-border remittance app using stablecoins.

The Twist:
We had zero Web3 experience.

But we weren’t scared. We rolled up our sleeves, and with help from ChatGPT, Google, and grit — we went all in. With just two people in our team, we did what others were doing in groups of four. We learned about MetaMask, smart contracts, and stablecoins from scratch and built the core features of our app.

We slept just 2 hours during the entire hackathon. The rest? Pure code and caffeine. Though we couldn’t stay until the final presentation (train issues), it was a crazy learning curve and a solid start to our hackathon life.

🏥 Hackathon 2 – Fluxus IIT Indore & GCOE Nagpur (21 Feb 2025)

While still recovering from Hackathon #1, we were simultaneously building a Healthcare Management System MVP for Fluxus, IIT Indore. But the real thrill came just days later when we got selected for another onsite hackathon at Government College of Engineering, Nagpur.

This was an 8-hour sprint, and we decided to build an AI-powered chatbot for mental health support — designed to offer emotional well-being assessments and supportive responses.

We created a polished UI (inspired by ChatGPT and DeepSeek), integrated an AI API, and presented confidently. But then came the real lesson…

The judges smiled (a bit too hard) — not because they were impressed, but because they found our project too basic. We simply used an API instead of building an actual AI model. Their feedback?

“This is just an integration. Try building something from scratch next time.”

It stung. But it stuck. That’s when I learned the golden rule of hackathons: Innovation matters more than completion.

♻️ Hackathon 3 – Sipna COET Amravati (10 March 2025)

This hackathon was... chaos and fun rolled into one.

Just one day before the 24-hour hackathon, the organizers changed the rules. We were now supposed to build the entire project at home and just present it onsite. It was 7:30 p.m. when we got the news. The clock had started ticking.

We worked overnight till 2 a.m., caught a train at 5 a.m., and completed the final touches on the way to Amravati.

The Project:
A gamified solid waste management platform for children — blending education with fun through interactive games.

Our team had:

Me (backend & auth),
Jayant (frontend),
Omkar (game dev),
Omkar’s girlfriend (presentation).

The journey was fun (especially the train ride with no hygiene — a first-time experience for Omkar’s girlfriend 😅). The event went well, and though we weren’t selected for Round 2, we presented confidently. I handled the backend explanation, and Omkar’s girlfriend nailed the presentation. It was a team effort, and a wholesome memory.

🧑‍⚕️ Hackathon 4 – IIT Indore (14–16 March 2025)

This one was special. We'd been working on our Healthcare Management System for 15+ days. Jayant handled the refined frontend, while I focused on the backend and features like:

Authentication using Firebase,
Notifications & reminders for appointments,
Medical certificate generation.

We boarded our train from Nagpur at 7:30 p.m. on 13th March and coded improvements during the 15-hour journey.

After reaching Indore on the 14th, we faced another challenge — no local transport due to a festival. We finally found an auto charging ₹200 per person! But reaching the 500-acre IIT Indore campus felt worth every struggle.

We stayed on campus for three days, attended cultural events like Kavanjali, poetry sessions, and a night concert by Shubharambh. The hackathon presentation took place on 15th March. Although we arrived late, we got our chance to present.

Did we win?
No.

Was it worth it?
Absolutely.

The presentation was smooth, the project functional, and the feedback valuable. After that, we partied with dances, music, and a moment I won’t forget — a girl in the auditorium smiling at me while clicking a snap. Maybe a future story begins there? 😄

🌟 What I Learned from 4 Hackathons in 30 Days

You don’t need a big team. You need a dedicated team.
Startups don’t succeed just by working — innovation matters.
Be ready for last-minute rule changes, new cities, tired nights, and unexpected adventures.
Always build something from scratch or with real understanding.
Sleep is optional. Memories are forever.

Hackathons aren’t just competitions — they’re experiences. They’re about testing yourself, failing fast, learning faster, meeting people, and most importantly, enjoying the process.

And this is just the beginning.`;
