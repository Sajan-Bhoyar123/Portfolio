BridgePay: Simplifying Cross-Border Transactions with Web3
It started with a question: Why are international money transfers still so expensive and slow?

That question led us to BridgePay—our first attempt to design a Web3-based remittance platform that leverages stablecoins and blockchain to offer fast, low-cost, and transparent cross-border payments.

We didn’t step into this as Web3 experts. In fact, before the hackathon at IIIT Naya Raipur, we barely scratched the surface of blockchain development. But sometimes, the best way to learn is by diving headfirst—and that’s exactly what we did.

The Hackathon Wake-Up Call
We arrived at the venue with a half-baked idea and a whole lot of confidence. Our original plan? Something entirely different.

But when the final problem statements dropped, we had to pivot—fast. Terms like “on-chain authentication,” “EVM compatibility,” and “smart contract gas fees” felt intimidating. My teammate wasn’t even sure what Web3 was.

Our first reaction? Panic.
Our second? “Alright, ChatGPT to the rescue.”

From UI to Smart Contracts: A 24-Hour Gauntlet
Phase 1 – The UI Setup:
We sprinted through the frontend in under two hours. Simple, responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and a touch of Bootstrap. It gave us a small win early on—and that kept morale up.

Phase 2 – Backend Chaos:
Then came the real beast: integrating smart contracts for remittance. Writing Solidity code. Deploying on a testnet. Authenticating wallet connections via MetaMask. For nearly 10 straight hours, it was just trial, error, debug, repeat. We stared at more error logs than lines of actual code.

Finally—around 3:14 AM, blurry-eyed and running purely on caffeine—we saw the golden word:
"Transaction Confirmed."

That moment? Pure joy.

Why Web3 for Remittance?
Remittance is a lifeline for millions of families across the world. But traditional systems take hefty cuts and take days to process transactions. BridgePay aimed to:

Use stablecoins (like USDC) for volatility-free transactions.

Eliminate middlemen using blockchain smart contracts.

Enable real-time transfers between wallets, with near-zero fees.

Provide transparent transaction history visible on-chain.

In a world where blockchain is often linked to hype, we wanted to use it to solve a real problem.

Lessons We Took Home
Web3 Is a Different Mindset: It’s not just tech—it’s about rethinking control, ownership, and trust. Learning to code with decentralization in mind was eye-opening.

Keep the User at the Center: Every design decision, from interface to backend, was guided by one core user: the migrant worker sending money home. If it wasn’t simple for them, it wasn’t worth building.

Adaptability > Expertise: You don’t need to be a blockchain guru to get started. You just need curiosity, persistence, and the humility to learn.

Team Resilience Is Everything: We didn’t sleep much. We didn’t win first place. But we finished with something real—an end-to-end working prototype built from near-zero Web3 knowledge.

What’s Next for BridgePay?
This is just the beginning.

We’re already exploring:

Integrating KYC with decentralized identity (DID) solutions.

Scaling the platform using Layer 2 blockchains to reduce costs even further.

Building a mobile-first dApp to reach rural users with limited access to desktop browsers.

BridgePay may have started as a hackathon idea, but we believe it can become a meaningful tool to reshape remittance for the better.

Final Thoughts
Sometimes, the projects you struggle through the most are the ones you remember the longest. BridgePay didn’t just teach us blockchain—it taught us how to build with purpose. And even though we were just two students scrambling through error logs at 4 AM, we built something we believed in.

And that’s the beauty of hackathons. You may not leave with a trophy—but you’ll walk away with a story, a skill, and the hunger to build something even better next time.
